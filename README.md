# ☀️ Helios: Your Local AI Shell Agent

Helios is a powerful, local-first AI shell assistant designed to blend intelligent natural language understanding with direct system control. Think of it as your own personal **Jarvis**, running right from your terminal.

Currently in early development, Helios is already functional as a **natural language shell translator** with conversational flair — and is steadily evolving into a fully agentic, task-capable AI interface for your machine.

> **"Welcome back, sir. Helios is online."**

## ✅ What Helios Can Do Right Now

- 🧠 **Translate natural language to shell commands** using local LLMs (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com))
- 🎩 **Stay in character** as a respectful assistant, addressing the user as "sir"
- 💬 **Engage in basic conversation**, responding with witty one-liners via `echo`
- 🖥️ **Detect and execute real system commands** instantly (bypassing the LLM entirely for speed and precision)
- 💾 **Pull and manage local models** with a friendly prompt if none are available
- 📜 **Maintain chat history and session memory** with smart prompt management
- 🧪 **Command validation preview** before execution (you always confirm before a command runs)
- 🛠️ **Auto-installs dependencies** (`ollama`, `prompt_toolkit`, `psutil`)

## 🌍 What's Coming Next

Helios isn't just a clever shell interface — it's the beginning of a **local agent platform**.

We’re building towards:

- 🧩 **Modular agentic functions** (e.g. file search, summarization, automation tasks)
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Multi-step reasoning and task planning**
- 📅 **Calendar or productivity integration**
- 🧠 **Local tool use via toolformer-style or ReAct-style interfaces**
- 🪪 **Persistent memory, goal-setting, and action logging**
- 🔒 **Secure system command access policies**

All of this, **without cloud dependencies**. Everything runs locally — keeping you in control of your data and machine.

## ⚠️ Responsible Use Notice

Helios is powerful. As development progresses, it will gain increasing access to your system, files, and environment.

Please remember:

- **Do not run Helios with sudo/root unless you absolutely know what you're doing.**
- Always **read and confirm** suggested commands before executing.
- Treat this tool like any other agent that can interact with your shell — with care, supervision, and boundaries.

We are committed to making Helios safe by design, but **you are responsible for what it executes on your machine.**
